# BC GEOGRAPHIC WAREHOUSE DATA PUBLICATION

When data is published to the BCGW, it must undergo a rigorous and standardized publication process to ensure adherence to government data standards for quality and consistency.  DataBC has well documented Data Standards and Guidelines that are followed throughout the process for data publication.  

The workflows described below will guide you through what your responsibilities are as the client and how we work with you to load and publish your dataset in the BCGW.

_This page is written in the context that you have reviewed the documentation as listed below._
