	+ [HEADER - LEVEL 3](#header---level-3)
		+ [HEADER - LEVEL 4](#header---level-4)
			+ [HEADER - LEVEL 5](#header---level-5)

-----------------------

## DOCUMENTATION REVIEW

Include a list of documents that are **required** for the reader to review. 

-----------------------

## HEADER - LEVEL 2

Generally, the sections will be defined at the Level 2 Header.

This section contains general formatting information for pages published in this repo.

-----------------------

### HEADER - LEVEL 3

Numbered lists can be automatically numbered and represented like this:
1. This is the first list item
1. This is the second list item
1. This is the last list item
It is helpful to use the auto-numbering as you can re-order list items and do not need to worry about re-numbering the list items.

-----------------------

#### HEADER - LEVEL 4

**Bullets, Hyperlinks, Bold and Italic**

When using bullets, they can be represented using the plus sign or an asterisk and indented using a tab:
* All definitions should be moved to the [**Glossary**](glossary.md), linked to the particular text and italicized e.g., [_Data Custodian_](glossary.md#data-custodian)
+ Hyperlinks:
	+ Hyperlinks to pages within this repo should be linked using the .md as well as the specific section (where applicable) and **bolded** e.g., BC Data Catalogue > BCDC Standards and Guidelines > [**Roles and Responsibilities**](dsg_bcdc_roles_responsibilities.md#the-data-steward)
	* Hyperlinks to external pages shoudl be represented using a permalink where possible and using the URL if no permalink is available. e.g., [Data Catalogue](https://data.gov.bc.ca/)
	
-----------------------

##### HEADER - LEVEL 5

Add in a Return to Top link at the bottom of long sections to help users navigate easier.
Use a series of short dashes as a line separating sections. These could be used solely within a level 2 section for shorter pages or in-between levels 2-3-4-5 for longer pages.
