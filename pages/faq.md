## DATA PUBLICATION LICENSING OPTIONS - OPEN DATA/ACCESS ONLY

### What is Open Data and what is the difference between Open Data and "Access Only" public data?

The following sections will help explain the difference between **Open Data** and **Access Only** public data.

#### What does **Open Data** mean?

+ "_Open Data_ is the idea that some data should be freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish, without restrictions from copyright, patents or other mechanisms of control" - [_Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data)

#### What does **Access Only** mean?

+ For the reproduction of materials found in the [_BC Data Catalogue_](http://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/), either a licence agreement (as specified in the BC Data Catalogue) will apply, or the materials are _Access Only_ and reproduction is not permitted without written permission.
+ To request permission, please complete the [_Copyright Permission Request Form_](https://forms.gov.bc.ca/copyright-permission-request/). 
   + If a licence agreement applies, permission is subject to the terms of the specified licence.
   
#### What does **Crown Copyright** mean?

+ Crown copyright is a form of copyright claim used by the governments of a number of Commonwealth realms. It provides special copyright rules for the Crown, i.e. government departments and (generally) state entities - [_Wikipedia_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_copyright#:~:text=Crown%20copyright%20is%20a%20form,and%20(generally)%20state%20entities.).
+ You can find information about Crown Copyright on this [_BC Government website_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/home/copyright).  
   

### Why should I consider publishing data under an open data licence?

+ Licensing data as _Open_ increases the likelihood that the public will benefit from the data, either directly or by using applications that can use the data.
+ As explained on [_this site_](http://opendatatoolkit.worldbank.org/en/starting.html#benefits), licensing data as _Open_ increases transparency, improves public service and increases efficiency, and contributes to innovation and public service. 

### Can all data be licensed as Open?

+ No, there are some restrictions, as explained in the [_Assessment and Checklist_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/open-data/open_data_assessment_and_checklist.docx) referred to in the next question.  

### How do I publish data as Open Data?

+ Datasets, under the Intellectual Property of the Province of B.C., may be eligible to be licensed under the [_Open Government Licence - British Columbia (OGL-BC)_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61).
+ To license a dataset as _Open Data_ you will need to contact multiple people to authorize the dataset to be made available under the OGL-BC. The [_Assessment and Checklist_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/open-data/open_data_assessment_and_checklist.docx) document includes the following resources (plus others):
   + Your [_Ministry Information Security Officer_](https://intranet.gov.bc.ca/intranet/content?id=DC4623F6F1944065B83F70297ED419D7)
   + The [_Intellectual Properties Office_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=4F03158C0AF84EC08DBB5BE3E873C33E) - email [QPIPPCopyright@gov.bc.ca](mailto:QPIPPCopyright@gov.bc.ca)
+ Data can be licensed under OGL-BC after:
   + The authorizations described above have been made, and the [_Assessment and Checklist_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/open-data/open_data_assessment_and_checklist.docx) has been signed off from your Deputy Minister or designated alternate.
   + The dataset is made available in an open format, e.g., CSV, Shape File (SHP), JSON. 
      + Additional formats are noted in the [_OCIO's Open Data Physical Dataset Format Standard_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/government/services-for-government-and-broader-public-sector/information-technology-services/standards-files/open_data_physical_dataset_extract.pdf). 
	  + Note that the DataBC Data Distribution facilities automatically make downloadable data available in open formats. Regardless of licence, people uploading data in proprietary formats (e.g., Excel) directly to the BC Data Catalogue are encouraged to provide datasets in an open data format (e.g., csv) as well.
   + A BC Data Catalogue (BCDC) metadata record for the dataset, linking to the appropriate Open Data Licence, has been created. 
      + To obtain an account for the BCDC, approval from the dataset's Data Custodian is required; the custodian may be a Director or Executive Director of the Branch responsible for maintaining the dataset.

### Are there restrictions on how data licensed under OGL-BC can be used?

+ Yes, this is explained in [_the licence_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61).

### How do I publish data as Open Data if I am a Crown Corporation or BC Agency?

+ The Broader Public Sector (BPS) cannot use the OGL-BC and thus require their own open data licence.

### How do I create an Open Data Licence?
1. _Copy_ our [_Open Government Licence - British Columbia_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A519A56BC2BF44E4A008B33FCF527F61), as it is consistent with the open data licences used by the Federal Government and other Provincial and Local Governments.
1. _Modify_ the following text to personalize it for your organization
   1. Change the Licence Name: e.g., change ‘Open Government Licence – British Columbia’ to ‘Open Government Licence – _BC Oil and Gas Commission_’. The organization name should be the same as is found on the [_BC List of Agencies, Crown Corps, etc_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=F024503C72F64D8380441972977188D6)
   1. Change the line ‘Contains information licensed under the Open Government Licence – British Columbia.’ to ‘Contains information licensed under the Open Government Licence – _BC Oil and Gas Commission_’, for example.
   1. Information Provider – change ‘means Her Majesty the Queen in right of the Province of British Columbia.’ to ‘means _BC Oil and Gas Commission_’
   1. Versioning – change ‘This is version 2.0 of the Open Government Licence for Government of British Columbia Information’ to ‘This is version 1.0 of the Open Government Licence for _BC Oil and Gas Commission_ Information’
   1. Remove: ‘Note’ line re: copyright can be removed
1. Publish the OGL to a public site so that it can add it to the drop down list of licence options in the BC Data Catalogue.
1. Examples: [_BC Assessment_](https://info.bcassessment.ca/pages/opengovernmentlicencebcassessment.aspx),  [_EBC_](https://www.elections.bc.ca/docs/EBC-Open-Data-Licence.pdf)

## PUBLISHING METADATA RECORDS TO THE BC DATA CATALOGUE

### How do I publish Metadata Records in the BC Data Catalogue as a Crown Corp or BC Agency?

+ As a member of the Broader Public Sector (BPS) you may manage your own holdings within the BC Data Catalogue.
+ To start this process, send an email to [Data@gov.bc.ca](mailto:Data@gov.bc.ca) with the subject line **Dataset Publication as a Crown Corp or BC Agency Request** and provide as much detail as possible.  

### How do I get authorization to publish records in the BC Data Catalogue?

+ To obtain an account to publish and manage data and metadata records for data, applications and services, approval from the Custodian is required. The custodian may be a Director or Executive Director of a Branch.
+ Please send the request and the custodian's approval to: [datacat@gov.bc.ca](mailto:datacat@gov.bc.ca).

### How do I change the contact name recorded for a dataset when that contact has moved to a different role or retired?

+ We do require that each Catalogue record have a way to contact the business area for further questions or access.
+ The custodian of the dataset can authorize one or more people to be editors of their records. 
   + These editors can then change the contact information. 
   + Requests to have editors set up for BC Data Catalogue access can be sent by the custodian to [datacat@gov.bc.ca](mailto:datacat@gov.bc.ca).

### Can I do bulk changes to Catalogue records?

+ Bulk changes are when over **20** records need the same action, e.g.,
   + Change a contact from one person to another
   + Change a resource or more information link to a new URL
   + Change a record from one state to another, e.g., Pending Archive to Archive or push a Published record back to Draft.
+ Requests such as these can be sent to: [datacat@gov.bc.ca](mailto:datacat@gov.bc.ca).

### How do I add/updated descriptions or short names of fields at the bottom of a metadata record for data in the BCGW?

+ These field descriptions and short names (for Shapefiles) all come from the BC Geographic Warehouse system metadata.
+ To update these, we require the object name, field name and the new definition for the Description or Short Name.
   + If there are multiple datasets or a large number of columns, we can prepare an export to use.
+ This request then be sent to: [DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca) 

### Why would I just upload a tabular dataset to the BC Data Catalogue instead of publishing it to the BCGW?

+ As an alternative to publishing to the BCGW, tabular datasets (CSV, text files, and Excel spreadsheets) smaller than 150MB can be uploaded directly to the Data Catalogue. 

+ The following table summarizes the benefits of each of the two options:

|Feature|BC Data Catalogue|BC Geographic Warehouse|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Has a metadata record in the BC Data Catalogue|Yes|Yes|
|Datasets can be downloaded in their entirety|Yes|Yes|
|Datasets can be downloaded by specified area|No|Yes|
|Datasets larger than 150 MB can be stored|No|Yes|
|Datasets can be uploaded/stored free of charge|Yes|_Sometimes_|
|Datasets can be secured for viewing or download by only named users|No|Yes|
|Datasets will be available in BC Map Hub|No|Yes|
|Datasets will be permanent layers in iMapBC and the Layer Library|No|Yes|
|Datasets will be available through WMS/WFS services|No|Yes|

-------------------------------------------------------

## IMAPBC AND LAYER LIBRARY LAYER PRESENTATIONS

### How do I update a presentation (layer file) for my dataset?

+ A custodian business area representative can import the layer file from the Layer Library available via:
   + the TSAT toolbar available in ArcMap on the GTS ArcGIS Desktop, or
   + the [_Layer Library folder_](\\data.bcgov\layer_library) directly (must have read access) to load into ArcMap   
      + If this is not available to you, the layer file can be sent to you.
   + Make the changes, as per the [_Layer Presentation Standards_](layer_file_presentation_standards.md#layer-presentation-standards) documentation
   + Submit, via email, the new layer file to [DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca) with subject line **Presentation Layer File Update** and attach the layer file with supporting details.

### How do I update an existing permanent presentation in iMapBC that is not my data?

+ Every presentation is authored by the custodial business area, therefore it is up to them to decide how they would like to proceed.
+ This can be done by contacting the business area listed on the contact of the datasets metadata record.
+ They will then follow the process shown in the [_above_](#how-do-i-update-a-presentation-layer-file-for-my-dataset) question.
+ A presentation can be changed during an iMapBC session.

### How can I request a new alternate/subset presentation of data that is not mine?

+ Refer to [_How do I update an existing permanent presentation in iMapBC that is not my data?_](#How-do-I-update-an-existing-permanent-presentation-in-iMapBC-that-is-not-my-data).

### How do I arrange for my data to become a permanent layer in iMapBC?

+ DataBC hosts iMapBC as a service for data residing in the BCGW.
   + To publish data in iMapBC, the data must be available in the BCGW.
   + Refer to the [_Data Publication Workflow - BC Geographical Warehouse_](bcgw_data_onboarding_workflow.md#data-publication-workflow---bc-geographical-warehouse).

### How do I get my data into WMS/WFS?

+ DataBC hosts WMS/WFS as a service for data residing in the BCGW.
   + To publish data in this service, the data must be available in the BCGW.
   + Refer to the [_Data Publication Workflow - BC Geographical Warehouse_](bcgw_data_onboarding_workflow.md#data-publication-workflow---bc-geographical-warehouse).

## ARCGIS ONLINE (aka AGO, B.C.'s MAP HUB)

### How do I get my data into B.C.'s Map Hub (the Province's cloud instance of ArcGIS Online) ?

+ There are two ways:
   1. Public datasets published to the BC Geographic Warehouse are all made available in ArcGIS Online ([_BC Map Hub_](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=DE0602BB42664AA28C9F059D45CC1CC2)) as part of the [_Data Publication Workflow_](pages/bcgw_data_onboarding_workflow.md#data-publication-workflow---bc-geographical-warehouse). 
      1. These datasets are stored in the BC Geographic Warehouse, published as web services and registered as items in B.C.’s Map Hub. These services can then be used in any ArcGIS Online web map (or used by other web mapping platforms that can consume ESRI rest services). 
	  1. In some cases we may replicate BCGW layers to ArcGIS Online; the data is hosted in ArcGIS Online and updated from data sources on a regular schedule to keep it current.  These "hosted layers" can then be used in any ArcGIS Online web map (or used by other web mapping platforms that can consume ESRI rest services).  This is a pattern typically chosen for layers that may see high traffic periods that need to leverage ArcGIS Online’s scalability to meet high traffic demand. 
   1. You may also upload datasets yourself to ArcGIS Online. 
		1. Prior to hosting data in AGO, consider if the data is already available via the public BCGW layers.  If it is already available, do your best to avoid publishing a duplicate layer.  Hosting data in AGO consumes AGO service credits.  If you choose to host data in AGO, make a habit of understanding the size of the feature layer and potential draw on service credits.  B.C.’s Map Hub has an annual allocation of service credits shared by all users of the service.  If we exceed the annual allocation additional service credits must be purchased – the cost of purchased service credits will be passed on to the users of the credits.  The size of a hosted feature layer is listed on its item details page.  For information on what uses service credits in AGO see https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/administer/credits.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_709121D2C7694DCAB9B8592F36F7A5BA.
		2. Data can be published to AGO in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, ArcMap, ArcGIS Pro, as well as uploading zipped shapefiles or geodatabases directly to your account.  For more information, see  https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/manage-data/publish-features.htm

### Why would I publish data to ArcGIS Online only and not to the BCGW?

+ Datasets can be uploaded directly to B.C.’s Map Hub.  This is a common pattern when:
	+	it is not desirable to make the data accessible via the multiple channels available for BCGW-hosted data (e.g., iMapBC, WMS/WFS, Data Distribution, Open Government Licence - BC licensing).
	+	publishing directly is an interim solution while preparing to model/load data to BCGW.
 + The following table summarizes the benefits of each of the two options:

|Feature|ArcGIS Online|BC Geographic Warehouse|
|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Has a metadata record in the BC Data Catalogue|Yes (if shared to public)|Yes|
|Datasets can be downloaded in their entirety from the BC Data Catalogue|No|Yes|
|Datasets can be downloaded by specified area|No|Yes|
|Datasets can be uploaded/stored free of charge|Yes (unless additional service credits are required)|Sometimes|
|Datasets can be secured for viewing by only named users|Not yet (planned in future)|Yes|
|Datasets can be secured for download by only named users|No|Yes|
|Datasets will be permanent layers in iMapBC and the Layer Library|No|Yes|
|Datasets will be available through WMS/WFS services|Yes (possible via AGO, may be limited)|Yes| 
|Datasets with personal information can be stored|No|Contact DataBC [Data Architecture Services](mailto:databc.da@gov.bc.ca) to discuss|
|Datasets with sensitive information (excluding personal information) can be stored|Yes, if the data custodian agrees. Contact DataBC [Data Architecture Services](mailto:databc.da@gov.bc.ca) for more information|Yes|
|Datasets can be made available in an open format|Not at this time|Yes|

### How do I publish a map to ArcGIS Online so it's viewable to the public?

+ Sharing content to public via B.C.’s Map Hub is a privilege reserved for ArcGIS Online administrators.
+ Making ArcGIS Online content available to the public requires a [checklist](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/data/geographic/web-based-mapping/bc-map-hub/bcs_map_hub_public_publication_checklist.docx) to be completed and approved by the director of the business area responsible for the content (i.e., the Data Custodian).
+ Metadata is required for ArcGIS Online hosted datasets when they are shared to public.  BC Data Catalogue records and ArcGIS Online item details pages must be populated as per the procedures described at [BC Map Hub](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=DE0602BB42664AA28C9F059D45CC1CC2
iv.	For more information on the workflow to share content to public from ArcGIS Online please see:  https://www.yammer.com/gov.bc.ca/threads/1207288411

## THE BC GEOGRAPHIC WAREHOUSE (BCGW)

### How do I publish data to the BCGW? Who do I contact at DataBC to publish my data to the BCGW?

+ Refer to the [_Data Publication Workflow - BC Geographical Warehouse_](bcgw_data_onboarding_workflow.md#data-publication-workflow---bc-geographical-warehouse).


### How long does it take to publish to the BCGW?

The length of time it takes is dependent on many factors but can take anywhere from one week to many.  The main reason for delay is lack of data readiness. 

Before asking to publish data to the BCGW, consider:

1. Data readiness
   1. Have all the fields been finalized?
   1. Is there permission to publish the data?
   1. Has all the line work been entered?
1. Does the data flow fit with existing architectural patterns?
1. Data access - do firewalls need to be opened up, or grants applied?
1. Do you have time to answer questions and check for quality as the publication proceeds?
1. Is there funding available?  (Note that funding is not always a requirement.)

### What data service formats can be made available for my BCGW data?

1. Web Map Service (WMS)
2. Web Feature Service (WFS)
3. Esri Rest 

### What government channels can be used to access my BCGW data?

1. iMapBC
2. BC Map Hub (ArcGIS Online, aka AGO)
3. Data Download from iMapBC and the BC Data Catalogue

### Refreshing Data - the ETL Process

#### What is ETL?

+ _ETL_ stands for **Extract, Transform, Load**.  
+ Extracting data from a source system, possibly performing some operations on the data, and then loading the result into the BCGW. 
+ Within DataBC, _ETL_ is also referred to as _replication_.

#### How is a dataset replicated to the BCGW?

+ Data is replicated to the BCGW using different products that suit the specific architecture of the data.

#### Where can datasets be replicated from?

##### The DataBC File Staging Area

+ The Staging Area is a permanent location managed by DataBC to allow the transfer of file based data that is publication ready to be replicated to the BC Geographic Warehouse.

##### The BC Data Catalogue file store

+ The BC Data Catalogue can store CSV, XLSX, JSON, and zipped shapefiles as long as their size is less than 150 MB. 
+ Such files can be used as sources for the replication process.

##### A RESTful Web Service

+ RESTful Web Services allow data to be transferred between systems using the HTTP protocol. 
+ A RESTful API is an application program interface that, among other things, can allow a user to fetch data from a source system by navigating to a URL in a web browser.  
+ The BC Data Catalogue is built using a Restful API called the CKAN API. 
+ Some datasets in the BCGW are replicated from source systems using RESTful web services.  

##### An Operational Database

+ A source database managed by a business area with a (BCGW-ready) table or view to be replicated to the BCGW.

#### How often is my dataset refreshed in the BCGW?

+ Refresh schedules are determined in consultation with the Data Custodian. The frequency may be anywhere from hourly to annually, depending on consumption requirements and how often the source data changes. "On request" replications are also supported.
+ For further information, email [DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca).

#### How do I request that my dataset be refreshed (outside the normal schedule)?

+ Email [DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca) with the subject line **Dataset Refresh Request - Outside of Normal Schedule**, providing the url of the dataset(s) affected.

#### How do I get the refresh scheduled frequency changed?

+ The refresh frequency of a dataset may change over its lifecycle. This can be altered as needed to meet the business requirements. 
+ Email [DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca) with the subject line **Dataset Refresh Frequesncy Change Request**, providing the url of the dataset(s) affected.

#### How do I determine the source of a dataset in the BCGW?

+ A custodial business area or delegate may email  [DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca) with the subject line **Source of Dataset in BCGW Request**, providing the url of the dataset(s) to determine a source. 
+ As folks move around government or retire, at times the knowledge of the data flow may become unknown to a data provider. 
+ The DataBC Architecture Services team can assist with understanding how the data gets from source to the BCGW.

#### How do I change where my dataset is being replicated from?

+ Sources of datasets that are published into the BCGW change during its lifecycle and as such automated replication platforms will need to be updated to meet the new data management configuration. It is recommended to engage with DataBC early on when changing a source format as we can move alongside during the development, testing and finalization process.

### Access security

#### How do I change the security set on my dataset in the BCGW?

+ The security of a dataset may change over time with its lifecycle. 
   + Contact [DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca) to develop a plan and to alter a security profile. 
   + Altering a security profile will potentially include changes to BCGW Oracle Grants, iMapBC/IMF2, Distribution and its metadata in the BC Data Catalogue.

### Downloading data from the BC Geographic Warehouse

#### How do I make something downloadable from the BCGW?

+ A custodial business are may choose to make datasets in the BCGW under their authority downloadable. Data can be downloaded using either the BC Data Catalogue or iMapBC.
+ Contact [DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca) to discuss the desired security profile. Security options are,
     1. Public download,
     1. Download when authenticated with a valid IDIR,
     1. Download when authenticated with a valid IDIR or Business BCeID,
     1. Download only be specific IDIRs,
     1. Download only be specific IDIRs or Business BCeIDs

#### I download data frequently, can I find my past orders?

+ This option is available for users who log in to iMapBC or the BC Data Catalogue when downloading datasets.

### Feature Codes

#### How do I get a Feature Code (FCODE) created/updated?

+ Feature Codes or FCODEs are no longer mandatory in the BCGW.
+ here are however still cases where these are needed.
+ To obtain a new FCODE, contact [DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca).

#### Do I really need Feature Codes?

+ Feature Codes or FCODEs are not mandatory in the BCGW but they are still useful to delineate features in a dataset.
+ Datasets that only contain one type of information do not need an FCODE.
+ Datasets that already have FCODEs that are used to separate and symbolize different values, it is recommend to create an FCODE when a new value is then created.
+ Refer to [_How do I get an Feature Code (FCODE) created/updated?_](#how-do-i-get-a-feature-code-fcode-createdupdated)

### What is the Geographic Sites Registry (GSR)?

The Geographic Sites Registry (GSR) is a set of tables and views in the BC Geographic Warehouse used to store and present geographic point locations where services are provided to the public.  

Examples of GSR datasets are:
+ [_Hospitals in BC_](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/383eaf98-afd7-436a-9556-67ecf14f64a7),  
+ [_First Responders_](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/652c49eb-7295-4ae2-8f26-39103f23b50d), and 
+ [_Court Locations_](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/c95a2ad5-f62a-43d6-8678-80a617b6200e).

GSR is architected in a way that makes it easy (and inexpensive) to add new GSR datasets and make changes to existing ones.

### Retiring datasets from the BC Geographic Warehouse

#### How do I retire a dataset from the BCGW?

+ Refer to [BCGW Data Retirement Process] for details of the retirement process

--under construction--

#### What is the retirement process?

+ Data has a natural life cycle that includes data retirements for many reasons.
+ A custodian within the business area may determine that a dataset, or set of data, is no longer needed for their business, or the needs of others, and they will initiate the retirement process.
+ Contact [DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca), for further information. 

#### Where is the list of past retirement notifications?
+ [Past and currently in process retirements](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/3b1c8bbf-4a17-43f0-a5e4-b3e518ef77d1)

#### How do I retire data and/or a proxy that is in the BCGW and which is tied to my application?

+ Contact [DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca](mailto:DataBC.DA@gov.bc.ca), for further information and assistance.
