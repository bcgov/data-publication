## It is all about the information

This guide is about managing information within the DataBC Program and making it available for decision making. The following points provide some context.

+ **We use a lot of information**
   + The Province collects and uses a wide variety of information. 
   + Much of this information is collected by business areas that have a responsibility for inventory and providing access to this information.
+ **Information is used for making decisions**
   + It is the reason we collect and provide it. 
   + The wider its access, the greater its potential.
+ **Information integration adds value**
   + The power of information for decision-making increases significantly when it is integrated with other related data.
   + Base mapping and other foundation data play a crucial part in providing a common geographic context for analysis and decision making.
+ **Information standards are important**
   + Standards provide the basis for information processing, integration and access using common sets of tools. 
   + Lack of adherence to standards severely limits data use.
+ **Information is costly**
   + The Province spends considerable money, time and resources to collect information and manage it.
+ **Information needs to be understood**
   + Information used properly can provide immense value. 
   + However, it can have the opposite effect if used inappropriately. Users need information about the data they intend to use in order to assure themselves of the data is fitness for purpose.
+ **Information needs to be managed**
   + Data are not static. 
   + Over time, they are added to, updated, deleted, and reformatted, and so on. 
   + Keeping information in usable form is not a trivial task. It requires active management.
+ **Information needs to be protected**
   + In many respects, information is a fragile resource. 
   + It is easily corrupted and misused, and loses its value if it goes out of date, or is not properly described. 
   + Some information is confidential, and needs to remain so. 
   + Someone has to set the rules for using information and, having done so, step up to ensure the information is made available according to those rules.

## The Data Custodian

**Definition: [Data Custodian](glossary.md#Data-Custodian)**

### Am I a Data Custodian?

If you are a director with responsibility for the business (i.e., if you have authority based on legislation or policy), then you are probably also the _Data Custodian_.

Unless this custodianship role is formerly assigned to someone else, you have the obligations and accountability described here.

### Obligations of a Data Custodian

If you are a _Data Custodian_ you have these obligations:

+ manage the data as a valuable business asset through its entire lifecycle;
+ ensure the data is fit for the purposes for which it is collected and provided; and
+ stay in touch with the users of your data and respond to their needs: 
     + by understanding the business environments of users and the information requirements of the business; and
     + by understanding the individual needs of users for access to information.

### Responsibilities of a Data Custodian

If you are a Data Custodian, you have these responsibilities:

+ **Data planning**
   + You decide what data is collected, when and how, its definition and purpose, which policies and standards apply, and which resources are utilized to manage and maintain it.
+ **Data content**
   + You decide user access rules, how the data is stored, promoted, distributed and retired.
   + Users for their part must respect the applicable-use policies set down by the _Data Custodian_.
+ **User advocacy**
   + You decide how to respond to users' business needs. 
   + You must understand the needs of the entire community of users. 
      + Of course, this doesn't mean you have to meet all user requirements. 
      + Rather, you should try to maximize the value of your data to users as a whole, balancing their respective needs.

## The Data Manager

**Definition: [Data Manager](glossary.md#data-manager)**

### Am I a Data Manager?

You are a _Data Manager_ if you have been directed by a _Data Custodian_ to have the day-to-day responsibility for managing a data set.

### Obligations of a Data Manager

The main obligation of a _Data Manager_ is to ensure that the _Data Custodian's_ directions are properly fulfilled. There could be several _Data Managers_ for a data holding, and the role can be delegated.

### Responsibilities of a Data Manager

You will typically be responsible for some or all of these activities:

+ Data capture and storage
+ Data quality assurance
+ Metadata capture and maintenance
+ Define business rule for security and access to data
+ Data population and distribution*
+ User support

*The _Data Manager_ is usually responsible for preparing data for population and distribution using the BCGW. The process is fairly straightforward, but it does involve a number of steps. DataBC will work with _Data Managers_ to make the process as streamlined as possible.

## The Data Steward

**Definition: [Data Steward](glossary.md#data-steward)**

When the _Data Custodian_ does not have the resources available to fulfill their responsibilities, or it may be more efficient to conduct activities in concert with another group, a _Data Steward_ may become involved.

The _Data Custodian_ and _Data Steward_ should sign a written **Data Stewardship Agreement** that defines the specific [responsibilities](#responsibilities-of-a-data-custodian) that are being delegated to the _Data Steward_ by the _Data Custodian_.

*Note: the involvement of a _Data Steward_ does not change the obligations of the _Data Custodian_. The _Data Custodian_ remains accountable for the governance and use of the data.*

-----------------------

## BC Data Catalogue Editor

An Editor is someone who can create and maintain BC Data Catalogue records on behalf of a Data Custodian. Editors must be approved by the Data Custodian for the Branch/Division in which they will be creating and/or maintaining records. To request editing access within a Branch/Division in the BC Data Catalogue, see [How do I get authorization to publish records in the BC Data Catalogue?](faq.md#how-do-i-get-authorization-to-publish-records-in-the-bc-data-catalogue)

-----------------------

## Metadata Contacts

Contacts listed in metadata records play a key role for end-users. When a question, issue or concern with a dataset arises, the best way to get resolution is to reach out to a Contact in the metadata record. 

Contacts can be listed as Custodians, Business Experts, Distributors or Points of Contact. See the [Glossary](glossary.md) for the definition of these roles.
