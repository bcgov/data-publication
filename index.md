# DATA PUBLICATION AND SERVICES

The DataBC Program encourages and enables the strategic management and sharing of data across the government enterprise and with the public. It is responsible for the BC Data Catalogue, the Open Data initiative and the B.C. Spatial Data Infrastructure and associated products and services.

Access to trusted, high quality data is essential for the success of British Columbia - expressed in effective government decision making, a robust economy, and improved well-being for all of its citizens.

The BC Data Catalogue provides the easiest access to government's data holdings, as well as applications and web services. Thousands of the datasets discoverable in the Catalogue are available under the Open Government Licence - British Columbia.

The Province's area, varied topography and predominantly natural resource based economy has positioned B.C. as a leader in geographic information management and generates a wealth of geographic information that is discoverable in the BC Data Catalogue.  The DataBC Program provides access to this information through a suite of unique applications and services that comprise the B.C. Spatial Data Infrastructure.

The information provided in this site describes the services that the DataBC Program provides for data publication, along with supporting governance, standards, guidelines and client workflows.
